part2:

- like part1, generate all the possible rectangles
- filter that list by testing if the rect intersects any of the line segments...
- if it intersects, it is out.

- all 4 corners touch _some_ line segment of the boundary....
- by definition at least 2 corner do, need to test the other 2.

- test if point is "on right hand side" for all segments in list?
-- need direction p0 -> p1

X - during boundary creation, concate segments that are in the same
    direction.
