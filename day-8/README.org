- read junction box coords into vec, size N

- create N HashMaps of size (N-1), one for each junkbox
-- the i-th Hash, each entry j is distance from junkbox[i] to junkbox[j]
-- this can be sorted by distance

-- don't need this, just need a heap of ((j1, j2), distance), sorted by distance.

- JunkBoxPair -- impl ord for Heap to work...

- Circuit, consists of 2 or more junkboxes
-- create: add a pair of junkboxes
-- add: add new junkbox
-- contains: check if circuit contains junkbox
-- merge: concatenates two circuits
-- could be a HashSet of junkbox.id

The world is described by a vector of Circuits ....

c[0] = 0, 19, 7, 14
c[1] = 2, 13, 8
c[2] = 17, 18
c[3] = 9, 12
c[4] = 11, 16


- part 2

1. connect boxes until 1 large circuit, find first connection...
2. note which two junkboxes were connected
3. multiply their X coord together

- end conditions
1. every junkbox has been connected
2. all circuits have merged to one
